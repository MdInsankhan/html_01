<h2>SIEM Structure:</h2>
<p><h2>IBM Security Qradar Implementation</h2></p>
<p><h3>Introduction</h3></p>
<p>This document contains the deployment architecture, prerequisites, and installation steps of IBM QRadar in the network environment. This document displays the overall Implementation Scope delivered in the IT infrastructure of United Commercial Bank Ltd.</p>
<p><h3>About IBM QRadar SIEM Solution</h3></p>
<p>IBM QRadar security intelligence platform provides a unified architecture for collecting, storing, analyzing, and querying log, threat, vulnerability, and risk-related data. As a result, analysts, operators & auditors using any of the modules are benefitted from the following points:</p>
<p>• Unified collection, aggregation, analysis of application logs, event logs, security events data & configuration files.</p>
<p>• A common platform for all searching, filtering, rule writing & reporting functions.</p>
<p>• A single user console interface for all log management, risk modeling, vulnerability prioritization, incident detection & impact analysis.</p>
<p>• One console security architecture approach.</p>
<p><h3>Audience</h3></p>
<p>This document is intended for members of the United Commercial Bank Ltd, solution architects, and technical team who have direct responsibility for the network infrastructure inside the IT network. In addition, it is advisable that those IT persons responsible for managing Network devices also review this document and provide comments and feedback where applicable.</p>
